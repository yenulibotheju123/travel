</p>

<p style="font-size:1.2em"><b>Why its worth visiting?</b><br>
Kandy is surrounded by hills, forests and tea plantations.<br>
 While it is true that these are things Ella and Nuwara Eliya are more famous for,
 the ones surrounding Kandy are beautiful too.
 One of the best places to visit in Kandy is 
the Bahirawakandra Buddha Statue,
 which is perched high on top of a hill.</p><br>

<h2>NUWARA ELIYA</h2>
<img style="width: 20em;color:white;" src="800x750-36.jpg">
<p style="font-size:1.2em;color:white;">Nuwara Eliya, often referred to as "Little England", 
is a city in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, 
known for its cool climate,
 lush tea plantations, and colonial-era architecture. <br>
It's a popular hill station and a major tea-growing region,
 offering a unique blend of natural beauty and historical charm. 
</p>
<p style="font-size:1.2em"><b>Why its worth visiting?</b><br>

This region is the heart of Sri Lanka's tea industry
â€”and the perfect place to dive into it.<br> You can tour estates like 
Pedro Tea Estate, Mackwoods, or Blue Field, 
which many consider the best tea factory in Nuwara Eliya. <br>
Even if you're not a tea drinker (guilty here!),
 visiting a tea plantation is still worth it.</p><br>
